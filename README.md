<p align="center">Ray marching in LWJGL (GLFW and OpenGL). Welcome to the barebones readme :/</p>

## Running
You can run `april` using the typical gradle run pattern:
```bash
./gradlew run
```

Building to a JAR file will be supported near the end of the project period.

## References

This is not in an acceptible academic format; this will be created near the end of the project period. Currently, this is an area to keep track of my sources.
