    <p>Ray marching in LWJGL.</p>
</p>

Sorry for the barebones readme, this is a school project so I feel it has to be "slim". See my other projects for good readmes :)

## Running
You can run `april` using the typical gradle run pattern:
```bash
./gradlew run
```

Building to a JAR file will be supported near the end of the project period.

## References

This is not in an acceptible academic format; this will be created near the end of the project period. Currently, this is an area to keep track of my sources.
